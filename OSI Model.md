# What is a Network?
A network is **2 or more computers linked together**, sharing data and resources.

## Types of Networks
| **Type** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------|
| **LAN** (Local Area Network) | Restricted to a single building. |
| **WAN** (Wide Area Network) | Covers a large area, includes multiple buildings. |
| **WLAN** (Wireless Local Area Network) | A home Wi-Fi network. |
| **VPN** (Virtual Private Network) | Allows secure connections over the internet using encryption. |

## Devices Found on Networks
| **Device**       | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hubs & Switches** | Connect nodes (computers) on the same network.                             |
| **Routers**        | Route traffic between different networks.                                  |
| **Firewalls**      | Filter traffic between networks for security.                              |
| **Servers**        | Provide specific services (e.g., print server, mail server).               |
| **Endpoints**      | End-user devices like phones, laptops, and computers.                      |

## What is the OSI Model?
The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** is a universal standard for communication in computer networks. It describes how network communication occurs and applies to any network.

### Data Encapsulation & De-encapsulation
When data is sent (e.g., typing a message), it travels through the OSI layers, getting encapsulated (packaged) and de-encapsulated (unpacked) as it moves.

## The OSI Model: 7 Layers
| **Layer** | **Name**            | **Function**                                                                 |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **7**     | Application Layer   | Interface for human interaction (e.g., APIs).                               |
| **6**     | Presentation Layer  | Formats, translates, and encrypts data.                                     |
| **5**     | Session Layer       | Manages authentication and authorization.                                   |
| **4**     | Transport Layer     | Ensures reliable data delivery to applications.                             |
| **3**     | Network Layer       | Handles addressing and routing of data.                                     |
| **2**     | Data Link Layer     | Moves data between nodes and provides error checking.                       |
| **1**     | Physical Layer      | Transmits raw data (e.g., cables, circuits).                                |
