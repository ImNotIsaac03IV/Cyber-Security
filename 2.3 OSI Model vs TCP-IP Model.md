# OSI Model vs TCP/IP Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model are two frameworks that explain how data moves in a network.

---

## **OSI Model (7 Layers)**

The OSI model splits network communication into **7 layers**. Each layer has a specific job.

---

### **Layer 7: Application Layer**
- **Job**: This is where programs interact with the network (like web browsers or email clients).
- **Examples**: HTTP (web browsing), FTP (file transfer), SMTP (email), DNS (domain names).
- **User Interaction**: This is where users interact with the network (e.g., sending an email or browsing a website).

---

### **Layer 6: Presentation Layer**
- **Job**: This layer makes sure data is in the right format (like changing data into JSON or XML).
- **It also**: Handles encryption (like SSL/TLS) and compression.
- **Data Types**: Converts data into formats that the application layer can understand.
- **Example**: Compression of images or files before sending them.

---

### **Layer 5: Session Layer**
- **Job**: Manages the conversation between two programs.
- **It handles**: Authentication (logging in) and session control.
- **Example**: When you log into a website, this layer keeps track of your session until you log out.
- **Protocols**: NetBIOS, PPTP.

---

### **Layer 4: Transport Layer**
- **Job**: Makes sure data is delivered correctly to the right program.
- **Uses**: Ports (like port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS).
- **Devices**: Routers, firewalls.
- **Data Type**: Segments.
  - **Segment Structure**:
    ```
    | TCP Header | Data Payload |
    ```
- **Protocols**: TCP (reliable) and UDP (faster, but less reliable).
  - **TCP** manages flow control, error correction, and retransmission, and is more reliable.
  - **UDP** is faster but doesn't guarantee data delivery.

---

### **Layer 3: Network Layer**
- **Job**: Sends data from one device to another across different networks.
- **Uses**: IP addresses (like `192.168.3.1`).
- **Devices**: Routers.
- **Data Type**: Packet.
  - **Packet Structure**:
    ```
    | IP Header | TCP Header | Data Payload |
    ```
- **Protocols**: IP (Internet Protocol).
  - **IP addresses** help route data from source to destination.

---

### **Layer 2: Data Link Layer**
- **Job**: Moves data between devices on the same network and checks for errors.
- **Uses**: MAC addresses (unique addresses for devices).
  - MAC addresses are **48 bits long**.
  - The first **24 bits** identify the manufacturer, and the remaining **24 bits** are a unique identifier for the device.
- **Devices**: Switches, bridges.
- **Data Type**: Ethernet Frame.
  - **Ethernet Frame Structure**:
    ```
    | Ethernet Header | IP Header | TCP Header | Data Payload | Ethernet Trailer |
    ```
- **Example**: Ensures reliable data transfer between directly connected devices.

---

### **Layer 1: Physical Layer**
- **Job**: Transmits raw data over physical cables or wireless signals.
- **Devices**: Network cables, routers, hubs, Wi-Fi.
- **No Addressing**: Deals with the physical connection, not addresses.

## **TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)**

The TCP/IP model is simpler, with just **4 layers**.

| **Layer**        | **OSI Equivalent Layers**       | **What It Does**                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Application**  | Application, Presentation, Session | Handles high-level protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP)         |
| **Transport**    | Transport                       | Ensures reliable delivery (TCP, UDP)                   |
| **Internet**     | Network                         | Manages addressing and routing (IP, ICMP)              |
| **Link**         | Data Link, Physical             | Handles the physical connection (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)      |

| **5**          | Session Layer             |                  |                       |
