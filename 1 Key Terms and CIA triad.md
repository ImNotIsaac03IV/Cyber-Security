## Key Terms

| **Term**               | **Definition**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bit**                | A binary digit (0 or 1), the smallest unit of information in computing.      |
| **Byte**               | A group of 8 bits treated as a single unit, used to represent data.         |
| **Software**           | Computer programs and data that can be changed or modified by the user.      |
| **Network**            | A system of connected devices like routers, hubs, and cables that communicate.|
| **Defense-in-Depth**   | A security approach that uses multiple layers of defense, including people, technology, and operations. |
| **Authentication**     | Verifying the identity of a user or device to ensure access is granted to the correct entity. |
| **Authorization**      | Confirming that a user or system has permission to access specific resources or perform certain actions. |
| **Identification**     | The process of confirming and asserting a user's or systemâ€™s identity. |
| **Confidentiality**    | Keeping sensitive information private and ensuring it's accessible only to authorized users. |
| **Integrity**          | Protecting information from being changed, corrupted, or destroyed. |
| **Availability**       | Ensuring that data and systems are available and accessible when needed. |
| **Non-Repudiation**    | Preventing someone from denying their actions, such as sending a message or performing a task. |
| **Vulnerability**      | A weakness in a system or network that can be exploited by an attacker. |
| **Threat**             | A potential source of harm that exploits vulnerabilities to cause damage. |
| **Risk**               | The chance that a threat will exploit a vulnerability and cause harm. |
| **Threat Actor**       | An individual or group that uses threats to exploit system weaknesses and cause damage. |

## Summary of the CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is a core concept in information security, representing three key principles that help secure data and systems:

### **1. Confidentiality**
- Ensures that sensitive information is only accessed by those who are authorized.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Encryption (protects data by converting it into a secure format)
  - Access controls (limits access to authorized users)
  - Authentication (verifies the identity of users)
  - Data classification (organizes data based on its sensitivity)

### **2. Integrity**
- Ensures that data is accurate, complete, and not altered by unauthorized users.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Checksums (used to detect errors in data)
  - Hashing (ensures data has not been tampered with)
  - Digital signatures (verifies the authenticity of the data)
  - Version control (keeps track of changes to data)

### **3. Availability**
- Ensures that data and resources are accessible when needed by authorized users.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Redundancy (having backups or alternatives available if something fails)
  - Backups (copying data so it can be restored if lost or corrupted)
  - Failover systems (systems that automatically switch to backup resources in case of failure)
  - Disaster recovery plans (strategies for recovering from major failures)

## Key Takeaways
- The **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) is the foundation of information security.
- **Confidentiality** ensures data is kept private.
- **Integrity** ensures that data is accurate and not tampered with.
- **Availability** ensures that data and systems are accessible when needed.
- Understanding these principles helps in designing and evaluating security measures and policies.
