## Key Terms

| **Term**               | **Definition**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bit**                | A binary digit (0 or 1), the atomic unit of computing.                        |
| **Byte**               | A group of 8 bits treated as a single entity.                                 |
| **Software**           | Computer programs and data that can be dynamically modified.                 |
| **Network**            | A system of interconnected components (e.g., routers, hubs, cabling).        |
| **Defense-in-Depth**   | A security strategy integrating people, technology, and operations across multiple layers. |
| **Authentication**     | Verifying a userâ€™s identity.                                                 |
| **Authorization**      | Validating an identity and its access permissions.                           |
| **Identification**     | Asserting and confirming an identity.                                        |
| **Confidentiality**    | Restricting information access to authorized users.                          |
| **Integrity**          | Protecting information from modification or destruction.                     |
| **Availability**       | Ensuring reliable access to information.                                     |
| **Non-Repudiation**    | Preventing denial of an action (e.g., message sending verification).         |
| **Vulnerability**      | A weakness that could allow unauthorized actions.                            |
| **Threat**             | A source of harm that exploits vulnerabilities.                              |
| **Risk**               | The possibility of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.                      |
| **Threat Actor**       | An individual or group that exploits vulnerabilities.                        |

## Summary of the CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is a foundational model in information security, representing the three core principles of securing data and systems. These principles are:

### **1. Confidentiality**
- Ensures that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals or systems.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Encryption
  - Access controls
  - Authentication
  - Data classification

### **2. Integrity**
- Ensures that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered during storage, processing, or transmission.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Checksums
  - Hashing
  - Digital signatures
  - Version control

### **3. Availability**
- Ensures that data and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Redundancy
  - Backups
  - Failover systems
  - Disaster recovery plans

## Key Takeaways
- The **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is the cornerstone of information security.
- **Confidentiality** protects data from unauthorized access.
- **Integrity** ensures data accuracy and consistency.
- **Availability** ensures data and systems are accessible when needed.
- Understanding these principles helps in designing and evaluating security policies and technologies.
