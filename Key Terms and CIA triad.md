- **Identification** - Asserting and confirming an identity.
- **Confidentiality** - Restricting information access to authorized users.
- **Integrity** - Protecting information from modification or destruction.
- **Availability** - Ensuring reliable access to information.
- **Non-Repudiation** - Preventing denial of an action (e.g., message sending verification).
- **Vulnerability** - A weakness that could allow unauthorized actions.
- **Threat** - A source of harm that exploits vulnerabilities.

# Summary of the CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is a foundational model in information security, representing the three core principles of securing data and systems. These principles are:

1. **Confidentiality**:
   - Ensures that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals or systems.
   - Techniques used: Encryption, access controls, authentication, and data classification.

2. **Integrity**:
   - Ensures that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered during storage, processing, or transmission.
   - Techniques used: Checksums, hashing, digital signatures, and version control.

3. **Availability**:
   - Ensures that data and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed.
   - Techniques used: Redundancy, backups, failover systems, and disaster recovery plans.

The CIA Triad is essential for designing and evaluating security policies, procedures, and technologies to protect information assets effectively.
