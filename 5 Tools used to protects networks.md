IDS (Instrusion Detection System): A device or software solution that monitors a network for suspected / malicious activity and alerts network
defenders about the activity. It doesn't prevent the activity or take any action to respond. 
Variations: NIDS (Network IDS), HIDS (Host IDS).

IPS (Instrusion Protection System): A device or software solution that monitors a network for suspected / malicious activity and actually takes action to prevent it or stop it.
Variations: NIPS (Network IPS), HIPS (Host IPS).

SIEM (Security Information and event management): A tool used to combine security information and event management in a way that allows analysts and network managers to easily monitor it and make sense out of it. A SIEM typically centralizes logs and pulls in already centralized logs from many so that they are consolidated and searchable for network defenders to visualize and analyze.

EDR (Endpoint detection & response): A solution that monitors end-user devices for malware and responds to prevent it or stop it. This solution is meant to help mitigate endpoint security issues.

SOAR (Security Orchestration Automation & Response): A solution that is typically made out of a collection of tools that automatically handle security operation tasks, like scanning for vulnerabilities and responding to incidents. This type of tool automates tasks that network defenders might normally do in response to a threat or incident. With automation of this sort, network defenders can be freed up to do other work and more quickly respond to incidents that get past normal defenses.

Honeyport - a system (a web sever) or system resource (a file on a server) that is designed to be attractive to potential hackers and intruders, like honey is attractive to bears. The idea is to put a honeypot out to attract an adversary and confirm whether that adversary is trying to target you. It can also provide valuable intelligence about how that adversary behaves in relation to the target.
