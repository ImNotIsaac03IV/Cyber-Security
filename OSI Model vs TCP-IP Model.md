# **OSI Model vs TCP/IP Model**

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model are two frameworks used to understand network communication. Below is a detailed comparison and explanation of both models.

---

## **OSI Model (7 Layers)**

The OSI model is a conceptual framework that divides network communication into **7 layers**, each with specific functions.

---

### **Layer 7: Application Layer**
- **Function**: Provides an interface for human interaction with applications.
- **Key Details**:
  - Handles high-level protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS.
  - Examples: Web browsers, email clients, APIs.
  - This is where users interact with the network (e.g., sending an email or browsing a website).

---

### **Layer 6: Presentation Layer**
- **Function**: Translates, formats, encrypts, and compresses data for the application layer.
- **Key Details**:
  - Converts data into a format that the application layer can understand (e.g., JSON, XML).
  - Handles encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS) and compression.
  - Ensures data is presented correctly to the user.

---

### **Layer 5: Session Layer**
- **Function**: Manages sessions between applications.
- **Key Details**:
  - Handles **authentication**, **authorization**, and session management.
  - Example: When you log in to a website, this layer manages your session until you log out.
  - Protocols: NetBIOS, PPTP.

---

### **Layer 4: Transport Layer**
- **Function**: Ensures reliable data delivery to applications.
- **Address Type**: Ports (e.g., HTTP: Port 80, HTTPS: Port 443).
- **Devices**: Routers, firewalls.
- **Data Type**: Segments.
  - **Segment Structure**:
    ```
    | TCP Header | Data Payload |
    ```
- **Key Details**:
  - Uses protocols like **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** for reliable communication and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** for faster, less reliable communication.
  - Manages flow control, error correction, and retransmission.

---

### **Layer 3: Network Layer**
- **Function**: Handles addressing and routing of data between devices on different networks.
- **Address Type**: IP Address (e.g., `192.168.3.1`).
- **Devices**: Routers, firewalls.
- **Data Type**: Packet.
  - **Packet Structure**:
    ```
    | IP Header | TCP Header | Data Payload |
    ```
- **Key Details**:
  - Determines the best path for data to travel across networks.
  - Uses IP addresses to identify devices globally.

---

### **Layer 2: Data Link Layer**
- **Function**: Moves data between nodes on the same network segment and provides error detection.
- **Address Type**: MAC Address (Media Access Control).
  - MAC addresses are **48 bits long**.
  - The first **24 bits** identify the manufacturer, and the remaining **24 bits** are a unique identifier for the device.
- **Devices**: Switches, bridges.
- **Data Type**: Ethernet Frame.
  - **Ethernet Frame Structure**:
    ```
    | Ethernet Header | IP Header | TCP Header | Data Payload | Ethernet Trailer |
    ```
- **Key Details**:
  - Ensures reliable data transfer between directly connected devices.
  - Uses MAC addresses to identify devices on the same network.

---

### **Layer 1: Physical Layer**
- **Function**: Transmits raw data bits over a physical medium.
- **Address Type**: N/A (No addressing; deals with physical connections).
- **Devices**: Cables, network cards, hubs, repeaters.
- **Key Details**:
  - Transmits electrical, optical, or radio signals.
  - Hubs operate at this layer and broadcast data to all connected devices.
  - Examples: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, Wi-Fi signals.

## **TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)**

The TCP/IP model is a simplified version of the OSI model and predates it. It consists of **4 layers**:

| **Layer**         | **OSI Equivalent Layers**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Application**    | Application, Presentation, Session | Handles high-level protocols and user interaction (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).      |
| **Transport**      | Transport                       | Ensures reliable data delivery (e.g., TCP, UDP).                                |
| **Internet**       | Network                         | Handles addressing and routing (e.g., IP, ICMP).                                |
| **Link**           | Data Link, Physical             | Manages physical connections and data framing (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).          |
