# Parts of a Network

A network consists of two or more connected computers that share resources, files, and services. Below are the key components of a basic network:

## Network Devices

### **Router**
- **Function**:  Connects different networks and routes traffic between them using IP addresses.
- **Example**: Connects your home network to the internet.

### **Switch (Ethernet Switch)**
- **Function**: Connects nodes (computers) on the same network and directs traffic to specific nodes. Uses MAC addresses to direct data to specific devices within the same network.
- **Example**: Used in offices to connect multiple computers on a LAN (Local Area Network).

### **Hub**
- **Function**: Connects nodes on the same network but broadcasts data to all nodes (less efficient than a switch).
- **Note**: Mostly obsolete but useful for understanding networking basics.

### **Firewall**
- **Function**: Filters traffic between networks to protect against threats like spam and viruses.
- **Example**: Protects your network from malicious internet traffic.

### **Server**
- **Function**: A computer dedicated to providing specific services (e.g., web server, email server, print server).
- **Example**: Handles requests like sending emails or printing files.

### **Endpoint**
- **Function**: Devices that end-users interact with, such as desktops, laptops, mobile phones, or printers.
- **Example**: Where data ends as it leaves the network and returns.
